              <strong>When required by law (e.g., for visitors in the EEA/UK), our lawful bases are:</strong>
            </p>
            <ul>

              measure, and improve services and to help prevent fraud/abuse.

            <h5 class="mb-0">International transfers & security</h5>
            <p>
              Data may be processed in countries outside <strong>Pakistan</strong> and your own country

              to processing, and data portability</strong>. Where processing relies on consent, you can
